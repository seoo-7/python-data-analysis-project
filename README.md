Pandas Roller Coaster Data Analysis Project

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project analyzes roller coaster datasets to uncover insights about design trends, performance factors, and geographic distributions. The workflow combines data cleaning, statistical analysis, and visualization to answer key questions about coaster dynamics.

## 🛠️ Methodology

### 📥 Data Preparation
- **Cleaned & preprocessed** raw datasets using Pandas operations
- **Handled missing values** through strategic imputation and filtering
- **Standardized formats** for categorical features (e.g., location types)
- **Optimized data types** for efficient memory usage

### 🔎 Exploratory Analysis
- Calculated **descriptive statistics** (mean speeds, height distributions)
- Identified **outliers** in construction years and drop heights
- Analyzed **temporal trends** in coaster construction
- Compared **regional performance metrics** across continents

### 🧩 Feature Analysis
- Examined distributions of:
  - Speed ranges (30-150+ mph)
  - Height categories (family vs. extreme coasters)
  - Material types (steel vs. wooden structures)
- Assessed **duration patterns** for ride experiences

## 📊 Visualization Highlights
- **Comparative histograms**: Speed distributions by decade
- **Scatter matrix plots**: Height vs. Length vs. Duration relationships
- **Geospatial heatmaps**: Regional concentration of record-breaking coasters
- **Manufacturer timelines**: Innovation trends among top builders

## 🛠️ Tools
- **Pandas**: Data wrangling and statistical analysis
- **Matplotlib**: Visual storytelling and insight communication
- **Python**: Scripting and analytical workflows
